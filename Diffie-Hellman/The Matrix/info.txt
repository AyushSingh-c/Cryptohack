This is rsa in group GF(50, GF(2)) - given a plaintext P matrix the ciphertext C matrix = P^e (where e = 31337)
    let G represent GF(50, GF(2)) 
    |G| is order of this field
        d*e == 1 mod |G|
    we need to find d to get the P matrix from C as  P = C^d 
        as C belongs in G, |C| divides |G|(by Lagrange's theorem)
        we need to find the order of C matrix and fortunately we can with .multiplicative_order()
        d = e^-1 mod |C|
