we get initial N,E and SIGNATURE
we get suffix when we give new N

to get flag we have to generate a msg/E with 3 types of patterns such that encode(msg+suffix) == SIGNATURE^E % N

patterns    
    ^This is a test(.*)for a fake signature.$
    ^My name is ([a-zA-Z\s]+) and I own CryptoHack.org$
    btc_check

values with each pattern we get are - [a, b, a^b^flag]

we can get valid bitcoin addresses from the net - BTC_valid_addresses
    these satisfies the btc_check function

now we have a partial discrete logarithm where we need to choose e, n given g, h st g^x == h mod n
    we can use pohlig hellman algo with smooth primes and get the perfect combo

Flag: crypto{let's_decrypt_w4s_t0o_ez_do_1t_ag41n}
